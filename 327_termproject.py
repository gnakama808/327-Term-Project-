#TEST AREA/Brainstorm Area
#Objective: write a program that allows two or more computers to synchronize files via LAN
#           should also be able to synchronize multidirectionally (both ways, all ways)
#           Ex. Node P1 has client C1, F1 is the set of all files on P1, etc. etc.
#           Most likely need "distributed hash table" or DHT

#How does the client discover other clients on the network?
#How does the client deal with files of the same name but different contents? Different timestamps?
#How does the client determine the order of syncing with regards to the files of other clients?

#RECALL 326 notes
#Suggest looking into coding in the Terminal, remember 326 and coding in C and C++
#Start off small
#Make one node, connect the node to a client, then make another node and connect the two nodes
